# Map-Generator
 A project to generate multiple types of maps, suitable for table-top games or story-telling, or whatever you like. Currently builds a variety of land masses using perlin noise to generate a height map and a shader gradient to apply meaningful color stops.
 
## Install
Map-Generator is still in development and hasn't had been released yet. If you like, you can build it from source by cloning or downloading this git repository. You're absolutely welcome to do so.

## Building and Tools
Map-Generator is created in Godot 3.4. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a FOSS game engine and you can get it from itch.io, steam, or their website. 

If you're building for Windows, you might need to follow the instructions for installing [rcedit-x64](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/changing_application_icon_for_windows.html) to get the build application icons to work properly. That isn't required though.

## Road Map Goals
* Configurable noise.
* User placeable cities and "region names"
* height-based indexing for automated feature placement
* Daily dungeon map
* Daily city map
* Larger map package that includes various generated points of interest - dungeons and cities.
* thematic encounters and wandering monster tables
